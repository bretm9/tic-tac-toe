## Overview
I am a Front-End student at Turing School of Software and Design. This project was my final assignment for Module 1, and a culmination of my learning up until that point. My focus during this project was to solidify my understanding of HTML, CSS and Javascript, and better integrate the various tools and strategies I've picked up throughout Module 1.

This website allows users to play games of Tic Tac Toe, and keep track of their wins. The page displays a gameboard and takes user input to update the data-model, which stores all aspects of the game-state. localStorage is utilitized in order to keep data persistant upon reloading the page.

### Goals

My goals, listed below, are taken directly from the Turing project rubric:

``` Markdown
- Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
  - DRY JavaScript
  - localStorage to persist data
  - event delegation to handle similar event listeners
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
- Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge
