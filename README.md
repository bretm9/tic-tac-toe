## Overview
We are Module One students at Turing School of Software and Design. Throughout this project, we were focusing on learning three core front-end languages -- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript -- as well as how to use them to implement responsive design strategies and semi-permanent data-storage in a clean, dry way.

The website itself lets users create and organize different ideas they might have. Each of these ideas are stored locally on the user's machine, which allows them to persist between sessions. The ideas are displayed on a constantly resizing grid, that displays appropriately on a variety of screen-sizes.

### Goals

Our goals, listed below in an abbreviated form, are taken directly from the Turing project write-up:

``` Markdown
- Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
  - DRY JavaScript
  - localStorage to persist data
  - event delegation to handle similar event listeners
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
- Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge
```
